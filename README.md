# ScoreTracker
## Overview
This is a pretty crappy ScoreTracker used to track the scores of board games.  

Includes a custom score calculator for Agricola (whicih was the inspiration for stating the proejct)

## Current Focus
+ Agricola
+ Games with built-in scoring systems (e.g. Carcassonne)
	+ In this case, this App is used for historical tracking

## Future Plan
+ Player(s) vs the board games (e.g. Pandemic)
	+ Require a different scoring system
	

##History
I initially started this as two seperate GitHub Repos.  

Using this third repo as a chance to bring the two together.  Also want to clean up the code based on what I learned from writing the first two and to move the frontend to Angular 4, from Angular 2.
